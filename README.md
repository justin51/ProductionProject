# Programming II - Final Project - Product Manager
This project serves as a demonstration of object oriented programming skills acquired during Programming II at Florida Gulf Coast University. I built this product manager over the course of the semester integrating new pieces of the project as we learned the concepts in class. The tool is an example of a product manager where a user can create products and then choose to "produce" certain quantities of certain products. The manager keeps track of all products and the production records in a H2 database.

In order to run this program clone the project. 

## Built With
I built this project using Intelij, the H2 Database system included in Intelij, and Scene builder which is also included in Intelij. Other resources used in the development of this project include lecture material from the Programming II course.

# Programming II - Final Project - Product Manager
This project serves as a demonstration of object oriented programming skills acquired during Programming II at Florida Gulf Coast University. I built this product manager over the course of the semester integrating new pieces of the project as we learned the concepts in class. The tool is an example of a product manager where a user can create products and then choose to "produce" certain quantities of certain products. The manager keeps track of all products and the production records in a H2 database.
